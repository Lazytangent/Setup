#+title: SwayWM Notes

** Check if node has =inhibit_idle= set
#+begin_src shell
  swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -e 'recurse(.floating_nodes[]?,.nodes[]?) | select(.inhibit_idle == true)'
#+end_src

This will print the node(s) that have their =inhibit_idle= property set to =true=,
which makes it easy to check for nodes that will keep the device from locking.
