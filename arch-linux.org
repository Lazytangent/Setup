#+title: Arch Linux Setup Notes

The notes here follow two guides:
1. [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide][Arch Linux Installation Guide]]
2. [[https://itsfoss.com/install-arch-linux/][It's FOSS - How to Install Arch Linux]]
   
* Pre-installation
** Verify the boot mode
To verify the boot mode, list the =efivars= directory:
#+begin_src bash
  ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
#+end_src

If the command shows the directory without error, then the system is
booted in UEFI mode. If the directory does not exist, the system may
be booted in BIOS or CSM mode. If the system did not boot in the mode
you desired, refer to your motherboard's manual.

(I probably wanted UEFI mode here...)
** Connect to the Internet
